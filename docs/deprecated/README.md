# Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains documentation that has been superseded by updated versions in the main README.

## Files

### REACTOR-OLD.md (formerly REACTOR.md)
**Status:** Deprecated  
**Reason:** Used outdated "Reactor" terminology. The system is now correctly described as **Temporal-based workflow orchestration** in the main README.  
**Replaced by:** README.md sections on "Workflow Orchestration" and "Architecture"

### QUICKSTART-OLD.md (formerly QUICKSTART.md)
**Status:** Deprecated  
**Reason:** Duplicated Quick Start information now in README.md  
**Replaced by:** README.md "Quick Start" section

## Why Keep These?
