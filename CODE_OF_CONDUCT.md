## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Contact Information

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

**How to Report:**

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to the project maintainers at [conduct@open-swarm.dev](mailto:conduct@open-swarm.dev)
2. **Issue Tracker**: For non-urgent matters, you may also file a private security issue on the project's issue tracker (mark as confidential if available)
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to any core team member listed in the MAINTAINERS.md file

**What to Include in Your Report:**

- Your contact information (so we can get back to you if we need to clarify anything)
- Names or descriptions of the individuals involved
- Description of the incident(s)
- Context and links to any relevant discussions or content
- Any additional information that would be helpful

All reports will be handled with appropriate confidentiality to protect reporters and those being reported on.

## Enforcement Procedures

### Investigation

Upon receiving a report, the project maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. Conduct a fair and impartial investigation
3. Gather relevant information from all parties involved
4. Document findings and maintain confidentiality

### Response Timeline

- **Simple Cases** (72 hours): Clear-cut violations may receive a quick resolution
- **Complex Cases** (1-2 weeks): More nuanced situations will be investigated thoroughly before action is taken

### Enforcement Actions

Depending on the severity and context of the violation, enforcement actions may include:

1. **Warning**: A private, written warning from the project maintainers, with explanation of the violation and expectations for change
2. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary suspension from community spaces (1 week to 3 months) with the opportunity to appeal and demonstrate understanding
3. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from the project and community spaces, with no opportunity to participate
4. **Other Actions**: Removal of comments, issues, or pull requests; removal of contributor status; or other remedial actions deemed appropriate

### Appeals Process

If a person receives an enforcement action, they may appeal by:

1. Submitting a written appeal to the project maintainers within 30 days of the decision
2. Clearly explaining why they believe the decision was unfair or disproportionate
3. Demonstrating understanding of the Code of Conduct and commitment to change

Appeals will be reviewed by a different team member (if available) to ensure impartiality. The maintainers will respond within 14 days.
